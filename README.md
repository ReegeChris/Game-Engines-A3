### Game Description:
The game that we have created is called Space Shooter. This game is a 2D-Fixed shooter game, reminiscent to that of Galaga or Space Invaders. In this game, you play as a spaceship flying through space as you travel a distant planet far out in the galaxy. However, the dnagers of space and hostile ships are trying to prevent you from achieving that goal...but you won't let that happen! By shooting your way through wave after waves of enemy spacecraft and asteroids you get closer to the planet. Each wave lasts around 10 seconds and the amount of enemies and asteroids vary each wave. Your goal is to survive until the final wave is complete.

#### Note: This game was originally used as Jonathan Narine's Assignment 1 project and Christian Riggi's, Ehren Chan's and Jonathan Narine's Assignment 2. For this assignment, I used assignment 2 as a base to modify and implement theobject pool
